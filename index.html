                    A simple and a bit dizzy game created for the 3rd edition of the "Madrid Crea" gamejam. The theme was to make something about 
                    Madrid, and so, I made a game where you skate through the streets around the Sol metro station, avoiding people 
                    and getting points by dodging them last moment. I made this game alone while physically attending the event.

                    First of all, yes, I suck at naming things, but I like making games, not naming them and this game was a very 
                    interesting experience as it was my first contact with the previous ESNE university, now called UDIT with 
                    their 2021's GameJamOn edition. The theme of this gamejam was: "Sustainable Development Objectives" and 
                    with that I decided to make a Reigns style card game where you have to manage a buisness balancing money, 
                    polution, stress and public opinion by making decisions over different scenarios brought up by a cast of npcs. 
                    I made this game by myself to experience how my now actual university organized events and see the level of 
                    their students.

                    Although it may don't seem like it, this is actually a game. Another GameJam product from a Student 
                    Gamedev Hackathon hosted by UpSync and Core where we had to make a game in core, their game engine 
                    (Which uses Lua). The theme was: "2020 THE GAME" and since it was one of my first games, I decided 
                    to make a simple obstacle track inspired by different 2020 events with a hint of humor.

                    My first attempt to make a GameJam game with a team, being the programmer, I had help from an artist 
                    classmate in this event my uni made called JAMaggedon. With an arcade theme, we even had to arrange 
                    the controls to work like an arcade machine's which was interesting. Here, you'll be playing only one 
                    level, but with three different characters with three different actions. Luis can jump, Iron Guy can 
                    teleport and Gravityn't can inverse gravity.

                    My first ever game, obviosuly made in two days for a GameJam because everyone knows that the best 
                    way to learn is under intense and stressfull situations. The theme for the 2020 GMTK GameJam was 
                    "Out Of Control" and that's when I came up with the amazing idea of making a lootbox based tower 
                    defense. As most tower defense games, you have a given path and spots where you can place your 
                    towers, although here, when you buy a tower, you buy a rarity and get a random type of tower based 
                    on that rarity. You also don't get to choose where to position the tower, as it does so automatically 
                    wherever there's free room.

                    A joke game I made with two other classmates for our uni. Here you embody the Karen Slayer, an IT guy 
                    who has grown sick of "Karens" and now goes around beating them with a bat, a very family friendly 
                    game as you can see. I'm mostly proud with the audio implementation, altough it's not very good, 
                    but it was fun recording the lines.
